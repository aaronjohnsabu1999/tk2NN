# tk2NN

A weird name, isn't it?  
tk2NN is an implementation of the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm on tkinter, allowing the user to select points and view the corresponding kNN graphs.
***
The structure of the tkinter project is very similar to a tkinter project by the same developer at [TKayTint](github.com/aaronjohnsabu1999/TKayTint). However, the applications are drastically different.
